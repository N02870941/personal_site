    <h2>Photography</h2>

    <p>
      Towards the end of my freshmen year of college, a friend loaned me their
      Canon T3 DSLR camera to shoot a couple events. This being my first time using
      a DSLR, the photos came out horrible - so horrible that I won't bother to
      do a 'before and after' to show my progress.

      After that, I was determined to get a DSLR of my own and learn photography. That
      summer, I saved my money (in combination with my college refund check) to buy
      a Canon T5i DSLR of my own. To me the camera was the best thing since sliced bread.
      It had a touch screen that swiveled out, interchangeable lenses, 60 frame persecond
      HD video, and more. I spent nearly all of my free time that summer reading the manual,
      watching YouTube tutorials, and taking photos of leaves and my dog Ceazar outside - I was obsessed.

      Fall 2014, I came back to New Paltz a new man. I was a sophomore, I had a better
      meal plan, and most importantly, I (thought I) had became a master photographer. I
      decided to market myself as a freelance photographer to on-campus clubs because I (was broke and) wanted
      real experience as a photographer.

      Fast-forward 4 years, I now look back and say I have come along way as a photographer.
      I remember when my camera bag had just the camera body and its stock lens. Now, I have to
      go through the pain of leaving certain equipment behind so that my camera bag doesn't
      swell up to the size of a suitecase. I can also say, throughout this journey, I have grown a love-hate
      relationship with photography. Before my friend's T3, my only other experience with
      photography was picture day at school and cheap Sony point-and-shoots from Staples.

      Being behind a real camera gives you a new perspective, both figuratively and liteally.
