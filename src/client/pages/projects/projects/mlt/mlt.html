  <p>
    Being Black and Getting Your Foot in the Door is a four part series dedicated
    to the professional advancement of students of color at SUNY New Paltz. On this
    project I am working with Dr. Cruz Caridad Bueno and Kadeen Douglas to help
    students develop their resumes, apply to programs such as MLT Career Prep, and
    take charge of their professional lives.
