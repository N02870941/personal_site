  <h2>Fitness</h2>


  <p>
    I love to 'gym' - literally. Well, conditionally. I love to gym
    if I'm working on anything that's NOT calves, quads, hamstrings, abs, obliques, hip flexers
    glutes, forearms, triceps, or shoulders. That narrows it down to basically bench press, and deadlift...
    and I guess biceps; but, I'm a little iffy with that too. To say the least - its
    complicated.
  </p>

  <p>
    I starting gymming in high school because I wanted to be 'brolic' - I know brolic is not a word, but
    you get what I mean. And if you don't...well, Google's right there. But anyways, I have always
    been an aerodynamic (skinny) guy. Being skinny has benefited me in many ways:
  </p>

    <ul class='no-bullets'>
      <li>I can squeeze into thin spaces...like that fourth person who's really not trying to stand on the subway</li>
      <li >I appear strong because I'm like the only one who can do a pull-up</li>
      <li>I can go ham at the chinese buffet becuase my metabolism is always a step ahead</li>
      <li>Plus...I haven't had to buy new clothes since my baby shower - JK...maybe</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The list goes on. But, at the same time my frame has also been a curse for me. For a long time
      I was very insecure about looking the way I did. And everybody's jokes and commentary didn't make it easier.
      Some of my favorites were:
    </p>

    <ul class='no-bullets'>
      <li>'Look, I can play the xylophone with your ribs'</li>
      <li>'I can wrap my hand around your arm without touching you'</li>
      <li>'You're so skinny, when you turn to the side you disappear'</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      I hated it. People would pick me up and fling me around, tell me I needed to eat more, and occassionally
      accuse my parents of startving me. But the one thing that drove me up the wall was when people
      called me "frail." It all started when I was five years old. I used to where T-shirts under my tank tops
      because I was insecure about my shoulders. But one day my shirt was dirty. I had to go sleeveless.
      Everything was cool, until I got to my aunt's house. When I pulled up to the kitchen, my older cousin
      just looked at me and said "...damnnnnn Bari, you looking kinda frail." That wasn't the first time I was called
      that word, and it definitely wasn't the last. But it hurt so much more that day. Any other
      day I did as much as I could to minimize my apparent skinniness. But that day, I couldnt - I was exposed.
      And for 11 more years I cringed every time someone called me that.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fast forward to high school, I had enough. I got sick of people calling me frail, touching their thumb and pinky
      around my wrist, and telling me that I needed to eat. So I did something about it - I ate. I decided
      the best way to get not-skinny was to get fat. I hadn't told anyone at the time, but I was eating
      more so that I could gain weight. But, to no avail. My metabolisms (I'm convinced I have two) weren't having it.
      I didn't gain a pound.
    </p>

    <p>
      Being as determined to get un-skinny as I was, I decided to go to the gym. At first, I hated it. It hurt,
      it stunk, and worst of all, I was still skinny. But a few months in, I started to realize my Hollister graphic
      T's were starting to fit me tighter, and people began to notice. They would tell me "Jabari, I think
      you're drying your clothes for too long" or "bro, why are you wearing your sister's clothes?" I didn't care though.
      I just knew I was finally filling out my sleeves and my chest was winning.
    </p>

    <p>
      Literally though. Those were the only things I worked on - biceps and chest. I used to stay after school every
      day just so that I could bench. I couldn't bench much; but I loved it. I started with the 45 pound bar. Which in
      retrospect, now seems like cake. But at the time it was a challenge. I benched that bar over and over, until I was
      able to add fives on each side, then tens, then tenwties. But, I wasn't satisfied. I wasn't going to stop
      until I could bench 'plates.' I dreampt of walking into that gym, telling my workout budy "throw on forty-fives"
      and me throwing it up like its nothing. However, my first time trying it, it didn't work out that way. In fact,
      it came crashing down onto my chest, and my spotted had to save me.
    </p>

    <p>
      I took an L that day. But I had the courage to try, and that's what counted. I knew that if I kept trying,
      that I would eventually lift plates and more. And that's what I did. I remember how ecstatic I was the first
      time I lifted all 135 pounds (my body weight at the time) off the rack, brought it down to my caved-in bird chest, and exhaled it
      all the way back up. I was hype. I felt like I could accomplish anything. My confidence was on 100.
    </p>

    <p>
      Lifting plates may seem light (figuratively and literally) when I look back. But, it was in that moment when I
      got over my insecurity of frail. I didn't look like The Rock or anything close, but it was those countless
      hours that I spent every day in the gym that build my confidence to say "I know I'm skinny, and I don't care...
      in fact, I could still probably lift more than you."
    </p>

    <p>
      Seven years later, I look back at what I looked like when I first lifted 135, and I would agree, I was still frail.
      But, not in the same way that I was frail when I was five. When I was little, I was mentallyand emotionally frail.
      I didn't have heart. I let people's commentary compromise my self-confidence. I let people push me into the dark
      shadows of long sleeve T-shirts and baggy sweatpants. Now my head is free of those demons,
      and I don't shrivel up when someone calls me frail. In fact, I use it in reference to myself a lot now. But that's
      because I have conquered frailty.
    </p>

    <p>
      Being frail been a curse and a blessing. During my younger years, it caused me a lot of pain, and put my self-esteem
      down. But being frail has also showed me how much power I have to reject those ideas and define myself however I want.
      From this journey, my biggest takeaway has been placing an importance of self development. Through lifting weights
      I have unlocked a new Jabari. I have unlocked a Jabari that is more confident, a Jabari who
      doesn't accept complacence, a Jabari who is tenacious, and most importantly, I have unlocked a Jabari
      who is unapologetic about his frame and how he shows up in the world.
