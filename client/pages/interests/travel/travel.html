    In the Spring 2013, I had the divine privilege of visiting West Africa. My
    middle school, <a href='http://www.learningtreeprep.org/' target='_blank'>The Learning Tree Cultural Preparatory School</a>
    brought the graduating 8th grade class on a trip across the atlantic that would
    change my life and world-view forever. <a ng-show='!showAll' href='' ng-click='showAllText()'>Read more...</a>

      I remember going through security at the airport, leaving my mother as I set
      off for Morocco. This was my first time on an airplane since I was very little, so
      every bit of turbulance seemed like the world was going to end. We got off the
      plane and I remember my first inhale of moroccan air - it tasted like heat. Not
      like hot sauce, and not like New York hot, I tasted heat for real this time.

      Throughout my twelve days in West Africa, we visited Morroco, Senegal and the
      Gambia - Senegal and The Gambia being my favorites. Some of the things that we
      did there included donating school supplies to students so that they could attend
      school, visiting former dungeons for enslaved people, and bartering in the street markets.

      Going to West Africa to a certain degree seemed like going back in time. But in
      retrospect, I'd say in general my experience highlighted the fact that my experience
      in New York does not reflect that of the rest of the world. I remember seeing people
      with diseases that to me, "didn't exist anymore" such as Polio. But conversely,
      I also noticed that people seemed to have more genuine interactions with eachother
      because they were not so wrapped up in technology and the media. <a href='' ng-click='showAllText()'>Show less<a>
