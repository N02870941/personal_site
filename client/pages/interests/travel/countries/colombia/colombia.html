  <h2>Colombia</h2>

  <p>
    During the Fall semester of (my first) senrior year, I had studied abroad in
    Ecuador with my good friend Layla. We decided to buy our flights together because
    this was her first time on an airplane and leaving the country. I remember
    speaking to a friend when he came back from his study abroad experience, and he told
    me his biggest regret was not having left time after the end of the semester to travel.
    He had bought his ticket for the day the semester ended, and best believe he was on that
    plane.

  <p>
    Having had that conversation, Layla and I decided to buy our tickets a few days after
    just in case. We didn't have any plans, in fact, we hadn't decided to go to Colombia
    until a few days prior to our trip. We did it off a whim. The semester was ending, and
    so were our funds. We couldn't afford to take another airplane, so we decided to do it
    by foot. JK, we took a bus. But, it might as well have been. We spent $16 on a bus ticket
    from Guayaquil to Tulcán, the city that sits on the Ecuadorian-Colmbian border.

    I hated those long bus trips. The seats were assigned, and I always ended up in the front.
    Had this been the United States, I wouldn't have cared. But, down in Latin America buses
    make frequent stops where local vendors climb onto the bus screaming "¡Limón limón¡" or
    "¡A los venticinco centavos el pan de yuca!" And the bus drivers always used to play violent movies
    all night! And the worst part about it was that those old coach buses don't have individual
    screens that play at a moderate volume. Out there they plaster one huge flat screen at the front of the bus,
    and play it out full volume "para que todo el mundo lo oiga bien." Fue horrible...
    Pero bueno, enough about the bus. For $16 we traveled 413 miles - that's good mileage.

  <p>
    When we arrived to Tulcán we our hair was looking a mess, breath was cooking, and our spines were numb.
    But, I was hype though, because I was about to walk across the border. How many other people do you
    know that have walk across a border? Actually I know a few; But, that's another story.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here were are standing at the border. We have no idea where we are, no plans, and no one waiting
    for us on the other side - It's about to be lit.
  </p>

  <p>
    We cross the border, we go through imigración, and we start our journey to Ipiales - the closest city
    that resembles my definition of society. We had to take a taxi to the terminal, and another
    random 2 hour bus. By time we got to Ipiales, it was already night - as far as I could remember.
    So the first our first mission was to find a place to sleep. On the second bus, we met a girl from
    Medellín, Colombia con el acento más extraño que yo he escuchado en mi vida - pero era buena gente, así que
    no importa. We decided to find a place with her because she seemed to have a good grasp on this
    Colombia thing.
