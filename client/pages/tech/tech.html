    As a Software Engineer in the 21st century, it is important that we keep our
    skillset up to date. Of course, one of the best ways to develop skills is on
    the job. But, sometimes the work gets repetitive and you don't find yourself
    learning new things. Another great way to develop skills, challenge yourself,
    and increase your marketability is to do personal projects.

    I am relatively new to developing personal projects - this website being one of them.
    But below, I have listed a couple of links to projects that I have worked on and
    a small write-up as to what skills I developed and things that I learned from each given project.

  <div ng-repeat="project in projects" class='top-border'>
    <h2>{{project.name}}</h2>
    <a href='{{project.href}}' class="black">
      <img class='full-border' src='{{project.img}}'>
    </a>
    <p>{{project.brief}}</p>
  </div>
