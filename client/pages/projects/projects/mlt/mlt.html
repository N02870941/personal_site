    As a Software Engineer in the 21st century, it is important that we keep our
    skillset up to date. Of course, one of the best ways to develop skills is on
    the job. But, sometimes the work gets repetitive and you don't find yourself
    learning new things. Another great way to develop skills, challenge yourself,
    and increase your marketability is to do personal projects.
