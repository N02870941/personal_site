  <h2>Biography</h2>

  <p>
    Jabari Dash is a Software Engineer and graduating senior who will be
    receiving his Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the State University
    of New York (SUNY) at New Paltz. His first memory of loving technology was at around 7 years old
    when he took apart his first computer (a beige Compaq Pentium II) and failed to reassemble it.
    Though he was not successfull in putting it back together, through his
    dedication to problem solving, and tenacious attitude, Jabari eventually sucessfully
    disassmebled and reassembled a Compaq Pentium III a few years later. This first success
    opened up many doors for Jabari. By knowing how to fix computers, he became the
    family technician - responsible for fixing desktops, laptops, printers, and any other
    device with an on-off switch.

    Throughout the years of fixing computers, Jabari grew a love for all aspects of technology. For him
    it only made sense to study them in college. He chose to study Computer Science because it is the
    perfect combination of his two favorite fields - technology and mathematics. As a Computer Science student
    Jabari has done three internships in the field of Software Engineering. Most recently, he held a position
    as a Full Stack Developer at Target Headquarters where he worked with a partner to develop a website to streamline
    and accelerate the process for internal Target teams to manage their database solutions.

    He has held several positions in clubs, some of the most noteable being the Historian of the Black
    Student Union, the historian of Hall Government, and the President of the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE).
    Towards the ladder half of his college career, Jabari shifted from on-campus clubs to roles such as
    Resident Assistant, and being a fellow of Management Leadership for Tomorrow (MLT). For fun, throughout his college
    career Jabari also did freelance photography where he photographed on-campus events such as dinners, award shows,

    classes, Jabari took a service learning course where he was volunteered at a local highschool as a teacher's assistant.
    Jabari helped teach English and Mathematics to 10th, 11th, and 12th grade students. The subjects he taught include trigonometry,
    basic physics, geometry, algebra, and systems of equations. Provided that instruction was in Spanish, Jabari also came
    out of this experience as a proficient spanish-speaker. Through study abroad, Jabari has also travelled to neighboring
    countries such as Colombia and Peru. He also plans to visit Cuba and Mexico in the near future.
