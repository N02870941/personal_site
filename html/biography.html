    Jabari Dash is a Software Engineer and graduating senior who will be
    receiving his Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the State University
    of New York (SUNY) at New Paltz. His first memory of loving technology was at around 7 years old
    when he took apart his first computer (a beige Compaq Pentium II) and failed to reassemble it.
    Though he was not successfull in putting it back together, through his
    dedication to problem solving, and tenacious attitude, Jabari eventually sucessfully
    disassmebled and reassembled a Compaq Pentium III a few years later. This first success
    opened up many doors for Jabari. By knowing how to fix computers, he became the
    family technician - responsible for fixing desktops, laptops, printers, and any other
    device with an on-off switch.

    it only made sense to study technology in college. He chose to study Computer Science because it is the
    perfect combination of his two favorite fields - technology and mathematics. As a Computer Science student
    Jabari has completed three internships in the field of Software Engineering. Most recently, he held a position
    as a Full Stack Developer at Target Headquarters where he worked with a partner to develop a website to streamline
    and accelerate the process for internal Target teams to manage their database solutions.
